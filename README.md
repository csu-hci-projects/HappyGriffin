This project is aimed at studying recall learning in a virtual reality context. In order to do this, participants will run a lesson to recognize the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet in a recall condition and a repetition condition. Participants will also be in either a manual or automatic condition.
The recall/repetition conditions are ran within subjects. They are counterbalanced to account for learning effects. 
The automatic/manual condition is a between subjects study. Participants will either pause as they desire (esc key) or will be prompted to continue (s key). 
To choose the desired condition, an initial code is set by pressing 0 (recall-automatic), 1 (recall-manual), 2 (repetition-automatic), or 3 (repetition-manual).

Included in this GitHub repository are the scripts used in our Unity project.
